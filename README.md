Chess React App!


This project is to create a chess web application using react and aws backend services.
This will assist me in documenting and expanding my understanding of react, modular javascript, python, and the AWS Platform. 

To use the web app simply create an account and click “New Game” to generate your first game. You can then click a piece to move and then click the place it should go. The white pieces move first. 

Currently the application is up and running with the following features:
•	User Authentication with AWS react component
•	Valid move checks from the server
•	Creating multiple games that will be saved in dynamo for each user
Features to be added/fixed
•	All pieces can incorrectly jump pieces like the knight
•	Connecting two users to a game to play remotely
•	Loading icon to wait for response from server when necessary
